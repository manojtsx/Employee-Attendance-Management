# Date Issue Fix Documentation

## Problem
The attendance system was recording dates as one day behind the actual date. For example, when checking in on August 10th, the system would record it as August 9th.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by timezone handling when creating "today" dates for database storage:

```javascript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (old way)
const today = new Date();
today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0); // Sets to midnight in LOCAL timezone

// When this gets stored/retrieved from database, it might be interpreted as UTC
// Example: Local midnight becomes 2025-08-09T18:15:00.000Z (previous day in UTC)
```

## Solution
Fixed by using proper UTC date handling:

```javascript
// FIXED CODE (new way)
const todayUTC = new Date(Date.UTC(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), now.getDate()));

// This creates: 2025-08-10T00:00:00.000Z (correct day in UTC)
```

## Files Modified
- `/app/api/attendance/checkin/route.ts`
- `/app/api/attendance/checkout/route.ts`
- `/app/api/attendance/status/route.ts`
- `/app/api/attendance/auto-checkout/route.ts`
- `/app/api/attendance/cleanup/route.ts`
- `/lib/date-helpers.ts` (new utility file)

## Utility Functions Added
Created `/lib/date-helpers.ts` with:
- `getTodayUTC()` - Get today's date as UTC midnight
- `getDateUTC(date)` - Convert any date to UTC midnight
- `isSameDay(date1, date2)` - Compare dates ignoring time
- `getStartOfDayUTC(date)` - Get start of day in UTC
- `getEndOfDayUTC(date)` - Get end of day in UTC

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
```bash
node -e "
const oldWay = () => { const d = new Date(); d.setHours(0,0,0,0); return d; };
const newWay = () => { const d = new Date(); return new Date(Date.UTC(d.getFullYear(), d.getMonth(), d.getDate())); };
console.log('Old:', oldWay().toISOString());
console.log('New:', newWay().toISOString());
"
```

## Impact
- ✅ Attendance records now show correct dates
- ✅ Check-in/check-out functionality works with proper dates  
- ✅ Dashboard and reports display accurate information
- ✅ Timezone-independent date handling

The system now properly handles attendance tracking regardless of the server's timezone settings.
